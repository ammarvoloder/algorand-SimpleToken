# Algorand SimpleToken

This project represents an implementation of a fungible token on the Algorand blockchain. Fungible tokens are implemented as Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) without need to write smart contract, but rather specify parameters to identify it as a fungible token (total count is greater than 1). The token is created and used to demonstrate a simple use case of creating and transferring a custom token from one account to another. For more information on token creation visit [ASA documentation](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/#creating-an-asset).
